<h1> Computing Help App </h1>

An iOS app based around helping with computing based tasks, that I'm using to learn swift. 

<h2> The app, when done should allow the user to: </h2>

- Add personal projects. They should be able to tag them with a name, a description, what languages they use and if they're completed or not. They should then also be able to filter what projects are  currently visible by language and/or completion status.
- Add uni projects. They should be able to tag them with a name, description, due date, type of project, group/individual project, languages they use, what year and course they're a part of. The user should then be able to filter what projects they see by a variety of those parameters.
- Convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal.

<h2> Other, Potential Features: </h2>

- An option to create "flashcards". These would belong to a collection (typically a uni course) and each contain a question and answer, with the answer being revealed once flipped.
- A knockoff Wordle-like game, only with words using computing jargon. On correct guess, the word and a description of it should be displayed.
- A "complete the code" game, where common algorithms in certain languages are displayed incomplete. The user must fill in the missing code to "win".
- A points system for the above games, where on completion they earn points. These points could then be used to change the app's theme, etc.
- Something with maps and weather, to practice them more.
